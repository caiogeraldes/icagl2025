## Abstract
Case attraction on infinitive clauses (contrast the examples below) has been 
analysed over the recent years as a idiosyncratic and strictly syntactic 
construction (Tantalou 2003, Spyropoulos 2005 and Sevdali 2013), lacking many 
parallels across either ancient or modern languages and across other 
linguistic _phenomena_. Previously (Geraldes 2020), 
I have tried to show that case attraction is similar in nature and distribution 
to _agreement / concord_, namely similar to the cases of 
_non-canonical agreement_ and _long distance agreement_ (as discussed in 
Corbett 2006), due to its association with semantic and pragmatic features,
using a _corpus_ comprised of Herodotus, Plato and Xenophon.
Effects of authorship, genre and dialect were also identified, with
philosophical dialogues and attic presenting a higher likelihood to display case
attraction.
The issues with the evidence and analysis made available was the sample
size, which limited what conclusions could be drawn from the data collected,
and the sole use of single variate methods to estimate the effects and
association between variables and the occurrence of attraction, which made it
impossible to untangle structural linguistic effects from extra-linguistic
factors.

Expanding on the aforementioned work, this aims to further the analysis of
case attraction of infinitival predicates of Ancient Greek, specifically on attic 
and ionic literary sources. The new _corpus_ includes oratory, dramatic and
historiographic literature from Classical Athens and a revised version of the
corpus of sentences drawn from Herodotus, Plato and Xenophon (published as
Geraldes 2021).

The nucleus of this work lies on a new quantitative analysis of the data built 
as to adequately estimate the direct effects of linguistic factors (class of 
main verb and infinitival verb, constituent distance, and part-of-speech of 
the predicates) on the occurrence of case attraction accounting also for the 
interaction between such factors and extralinguistic factors such as 
authorship and genre.
This analysis relies on the graphical causal analysis (e.g. Pearl 2009)
and Bayesian modeling (e.g. McElreath 2020), which I argue could enhance
the results of data driven linguistic research by including at the
quantitative analysis the qualitative knowledge built on the Ancient Greek
and general linguistics. This is particularly important as semantic and
pragmatic features often can only be represented in the data by proxies (word
classes, constituent distance and word order).

Furthermore, the evidence gathered reinforces the conclusion that case
attraction was strongly conditioned by the semantic and pragmatic features of
the sentence.
