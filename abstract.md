## Abstract

Expanding on previous works (Geraldes 2020), this work aims to further the analysis of
case attraction of secondary predicates of infinitive clauses on Ancient Greek,
specifically on attic and ionic literary sources.
It provides a new quantitative analysis of the data focussed on multivariate
effects and relying on causal inference theory (Pearl 2009) and Bayesian modeling
(McElreath 2020).
Effects of structural linguistic variables such as class of main verb and
infinitival verb, constituent distance, and part-of-speech of the predicates are
evaluated together with extra-linguistic factors such as authorship, genre and dialect 
so as to estimate the direct effect of the linguistic factors over case attraction.
